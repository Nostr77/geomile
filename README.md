# geomile
Optimizing script for the maximum poins inclusion in one square km 

# initial task from Texas
https://www.freelancer.com/projects/excel/Complex-calculation-points-using/details
I have 493 points in longitude and latitude over roughly a 25 square mile area.  I need to know which square mile the most points are listed.  This may be in the center or anywhere inside the area.  Again I need to know the square mile in which most points show up not just the middle of the area.  The data is in excel and in the format of the attached image. 

# assumptions
1) Square miles have to be actual square (1*1 km)
2) Plots orientation N-S 
3) Demanding accuracy - 1 m, regardless the errors of distance calculations formula (link to understabn the problem:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27928/calculate-distance-between-two-latitude-longitude-points-haversine-formula )
4) The result of most populated square km = coordinates of 4 corners + visualization 

# note!
It could not be a polygon, because you can draw a polygon, that is actually a stripe or star, which covers all your points at the same time (limited in 1*1 square km).

# Dataset 
Random, somewhere on the Greek-Turkish border. With the arbitrary shape (neither rectangle nor square)
